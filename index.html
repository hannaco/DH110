        This project will be focused on how we as individuals can contribute to sustainable city living. 
        Many sites talk about sustainability, but often are looking on a larger scale, which can discourage 
        the viewer or give them the feeling that they are alleviated from individual responsibility to 
        live more sustainably. Thus, I want to design a site that explains these issues at a large scale, 
        but gives the viewer action items they can do to take steps towards sustainable living.

        <p class="card-text">
          Many of our cities were not built with sustainablity in mind, with inadequate public transit infrastructure,
          and often become filled with litter and garbage over time. On the individual level, there are many sites
          that attempt to mobilize members of the community to do their part in making their city more sustainable.
          However, many of these sites are too general, or only propose solutions that aren't accessible for average
          individuals. Additionally, some of these sites don't educate the user on sustainability, or only provide
          articles that many may skim over. <br><br> 

          Thus, my project aims to not only provide users with interactive and fun ways to learn about sustainability, but 
          also give ways that they can get invovled. While my site primarily targets college students, this site can be 
          used by individuals of all ages and from various backgrounds. I wanted to create a website that motivates users 
          to be proactive in efforts to promote sustainability in their communities.

              To get an idea of how other websites were presenting information and getting users involved, I conducted 
              heuristic evaluations on two similar websites: <a href="https://www.unep.org/">United Nations Environment Programme</a> and 
              <a href="https://www.thegef.org/">Global Environment Facility</a>. I chose these sites because their goal was similar to 
              mine for my website. I used Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics to evaluate these sites and understand 
              their importance and role in my own project.
              <br><br>
              From my evaluation, I found that what was often confusing was how much information they attempted to present at 
              once, and how overwhelming this could be. In addition, I prioritized consistency of design throughout my site.

            <p class="card-text">
              To ensure that the issues I identified during the heuristic evaluation presented problems for users, 
              I conducted usability testing on the United Nations Environment Programme website. I provided the subject 
              with similar tasks to what I would have, and notes any thoughts and problems that they faced.
              <br><br>
              The results of my UT confirmed a lot of my initial thoughts on usability, as well as helping me understand 
              how a user typically interacts with sites. This aided me in developing the layout of my website.

              I wanted to take a step back from the specifics of my project, and focus on the user's general goals 
              and viewws. I asked a friend of mine to help me in understanding what the average college student thought 
              about sustainability.
              <br><br>
              Conducting user research allows me a glimpse into what others thought about sustainability and getting involved, 
              which brought up some new issues I hadn't considered, such as how the user's perceived impact of their actions 
              affect their interest level.

            <p class="card-text">
              An integral component of the design process is to understand the user's perspective, from their 
              goals and motivations to their emotions and thoughts. To accomplish this, I created personas, empathy maps, 
              and scenarios to understand the user, and to also filter out personal preference. Doing so allows us to 
              focus on the function of our product and and focus on the user's needs and goals. 
              <br><br>
              Using the results of the contextual inquiry, I created a couple personas that captured my target demographic, 
              as well as a few scenarios that outlined how someone might use my site.

              Taking into consideration my goals and the results of the user research and personas, 
              I outlined three main tasks I wanted the user to be able to accomplish:
              </p><ul>
                <li>Learn more about sustainabilty</li>
                <li>Find ways to get involved in sustainability</li>
              </ul>
              Keeping this in mind, I created a low-fidelity prototype, as well as conducting prototype testing to find any 
              issues early on.

              Before creating a full high-fidelity prototype, I first digitized and fleshed out a single 
              screen from my low-fidelity prototype. This gave me an opportunity to get feedback one the 
              colors, typography, etc. early on in the design process.

              The final step of my project, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. This prototype 
              helped me visualize what my final project would look like, and allowed me a fully-fleshed out product to 
              test with users. With this iteration, I conducted a few tests to try and create an end product 
              that was clean, intuitive, and useful.
