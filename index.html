        This project will be focused on how we as individuals can contribute to sustainable city living. 
        Many sites talk about sustainability, but often are looking on a larger scale, which can discourage 
        the viewer or give them the feeling that they are alleviated from individual responsibility to 
        live more sustainably. Thus, I want to design a site that explains these issues at a large scale, 
        but gives the viewer action items they can do to take steps towards sustainable living.

        <p class="card-text">
          Many of our cities were not built with sustainablity in mind, with inadequate public transit infrastructure,
          and often become filled with litter and garbage over time. On the individual level, there are many sites
          that attempt to mobilize members of the community to do their part in making their city more sustainable.
          However, many of these sites are too general, or only propose solutions that aren't accessible for average
          individuals. Additionally, some of these sites don't educate the user on sustainability, or only provide
          articles that many may skim over. <br><br> 

          Thus, my project aims to not onyl provide users with interactive and fun ways to learn about sustainability, but 
          also give ways that they can get invovled. While my site primarily targets college students, this site can be 
          used by individuals of all ages and from various backgrounds. I wanted to create a website that motivates users 
          to be proactive in efforts to promote sustainability in their communities.

              To get an idea of how other websites were presenting information and getting users involved, I conducted 
              heuristic evaluations on two similar websites: <a href="unep.org">United Nations Environment Programme</a> and 
              <a href="thegef.org">Global Environment Facility</a>. I chose these sites because their goal was similar to 
              mine for my website. I used Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics to evaluate these sites and understand 
              their importance and role in my own project.
              <br><br>
              From my evaluation, I found that what was often confusing was how much information they attempted to present at 
              once, and how overwhelming this could be. In addition, I prioritized consistency of design throughout my site.

            <p class="card-text">
              To ensure that the issues I identified during the heuristic evaluation presented problems for users, 
              I conducted usability testing on the United Nations Environment Programme website. I provided the subject 
              with similar tasks to what I would have, and notes any thoughts and problems that they faced.
              <br><br>
              The results of my UT confirmed a lot of my initial thoughts on usability, as well as helping me understand 
              how a user typically interacts with sites. This aided me in developing the layout of my website.

            <p class="card-text">Despite having an idea of what I wanted for the final product, I knew I had to learn more about what the users wanted and needed. My classmate, an Asian American Studies major, offered to give me a glimpse into what her day looked like. <br><br>

            I went into our Zoom call not knowing what insights I would glean but knowing that I wanted to see how she discovered information about a topic of interest. After discussing some background questions, I asked if she could show me how she typically finds information on the internet. It turns out she had been starting on her senior thesis on Asian American issues and decided to show me how she found sources for her paper.

            <p class="card-text">One central way to develop empathy for our users is to take their perspective. We can do this by creating personas, scenarios, user journeys, and empathy maps. These transport us out of our own lives and into the lives of our users. Throughout the design process, we can think back to our users' context through these materials. <br><br>

            Drawing from the contextual inquiry findings, I created a persona that captured the motivations, needs, and goals of the participant. Because I wanted to create a product for users from diverse backgrounds, I created two additional proto-personas by synthesizing information from the contextual inquiry and from my recollection of people in my life.

            <p class="card-text">Taking the perspective of my personas led me to incorporate three different features into my website. I wanted to allow users to: <br><br>
            •	Explore the history of Asian American communities with an interactive timeline
            •	Watch videos and documentaries about art, culture, social issues, and politics
            •	Find teaching resources to support curriculums related to Asian American topics<br><br>
            With these scenarios in mind, I took to translating them into tangible screen designs. Because the site centers around history, education, and culture, I wanted it to exude a professional, sophisticated air. At the same time, I wanted it to be approachable and refreshing.

            1.	Finding more about a historical event on the timeline
            2.	Download a file for a lesson plan
            3.	View a video documentary

This helped me envision what the end product might look like and provided a concrete visualization that could be tested with users. By alternating between designing screens and testing with users, I could iterate towards a better user experience.
