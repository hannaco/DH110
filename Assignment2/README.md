## Introduction

### About the Project
[UNEP](https://www.unep.org/)is the United Nations Environment Programme, and it sets the agenda for environmental actions and advocates for the environment. It informs the public on the UN efforts to combat environmental issues, as well as some ways that the public can get involved or help their cause.

After conducting a [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/hannaco/DH110/blob/main/Assignment1/README.md) of the UNEP desktop website, I identified several usability concerns that should be addressed. When it came to user control and matching the system to the real world, there were minor changes that could've been made to eliminate confusion for the user. In terms of flexibility and efficiency of use, some aspects of the site were not intuitive or difficult to navigate. Finally, the site was densely packed with information and rescources for the user to learn about sustainability, which resulted in some elements of the site looking cluttered or not uniform with other elements of the site. Overall, while the site is usable and helpful, it can easily overwhelm the user

### The Purpose of Usability Testing

**Usability testing (UT)** is done to confirm or identify areas where the user may struggle with the site's functionality, or turn away from using it altogether. There are three components of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. By observing users and giving them a set of tasks to complete, we can gather empirical data and observe areas for improvement, as well as what already works. We can get a real user's perspective, and and create sites and applications that are not only useful, but enojyable to use. Usability testing can help inform our design, which can save time and costs down the line. 

## Methodology
A pilot usability test (UT) was conducted in order to assess the materials, setting, and software used for usability testing. Due to limited formal testing space, the pilot UT was conducted in a minimalist portable test lab set up in a home setting. A laptop was used to run Zoom to record the user's facial expressions along with interactions with the website, and another laptop was used for the participant to fill out the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKkK4JFiPDIyvAw645oKG36WBJO_igeXGJS6PRohB4tHtyTA/viewform?usp=sf_link). The moderator sat next to the participant.

The usability test and website of interest was first introduced to the participant, and the participant was given an informed consent form to sign. They were given pre-test questions regarding either their previous experience with the website, which might influence test performance, or their first impressions of the website. Keeping in mind the usability concerns mentioned before, the participant was then asked to perform 3 tasks:

1. Using the symptom checker, finding the disease/condition causing those symptoms, and finding what types of treatment are available for that disease/condition.
3. Finding the types of insurance Mayo Clinic accepts from patients.
4. Finding information about vitamin D supplements, including who may need to take vitamin D supplements, possible side effects, and daily recommended intake of vitamin D.

After completing the tasks, a set a post-test questions was given to assess the participant's quality of experience with the website, including their perceived ease of use and efficiency, their likeliness of doing each task, and their overall satisfaction with the website (either using System Usability Scale or Product Reaction Cards). Finally, demographic information about the participant was collected.

## Materials

The questionnaire consisted of the following components:
* Introduction script
* Informed consent
* Background questions
* Previous experience (if applicable)
* Pre-test questions
* Tasks
* Post-test questions
  * [System Usability Scale (SUS)](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)
  * [Product Reaction Cards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microsoft-desirability-toolkit/)
* Demographic questions

## Reflection

### What went well:
In general, the user confirmed what I thought during the heuristic evaluation - the huge amount of content can be quite overwhelming, especially when not properly organized in a hierarchical manner, and a lot of information and features can be difficult to find. Furthermore, I identified a few more usability issues. For example, the search bar in the main navigation bar does not provide results for some pages even though they exist, including that of "vitamin D". Also, the wording in the symptom checker can make it difficult to find certain symptoms. Finally, the use of long paragraphs in the body text inhibits the user from finding information and discourages them from reading through. I also learned a few things about user habits, such as how users, especially more tech-savvy ones, are willing to scroll; however, they may develop "scrolling fatigue" if the content is not clustered properly or if they cannot efficiently find the information they want. Furthermore, each user may take a unique path to perform the task, not necessarily the one intended by the moderator.

### What didn't go well:
Firstly, in terms of logistics, the participant was not in my targeted age group, so the findings may be different than what I would expect from my target users (seniors). 
Although the participant allowed me to record their facial expression for my personal viewing, they did not want their video to be shown to others. Next time, if I want to use the UT session in a presentation, I should ensure that the participant is willing to be shown to others before inviting them for UT. In terms of UT itself, it can be quite difficult to encourage the user to speak through their thoughts aloud, especially since we typically use products quite intuitively. Therefore, it is important to be able to ask questions that invite the participant to speak more throughout the process. I should also make it more clear to the user that they can freely interact with the website to complete each set of tasks; the participant felt like it was necessary to use certain features of the website. Furthermore, it was difficult to give neutral facial expressions and body language, which could subtly affect the participant's performance. I should practice maintaining a neutral composure no matter what the participant says or does. Lastly, the tasks I created were quite limited, so there were some features of the website that weren't used as often as I had hoped, and I still had some questions about the usability for those parts of the website. Next time, I should include more tasks and questions to gain more insight and to help create a better user experience.
