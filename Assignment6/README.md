## Overview
### Description of Project
The purpose of my project is to design a website for anyone, but primarily college students, to learn about sustainability, better habits into their lives, and get involved in initiatives that make a difference. The screen that I chose to design is the homepage, which in my low-fidelity prototype, I did not get a chance to fully lay out. The name I chose for my platform is SustainableU, which refers to both the user being more sustainable, but also a play on words, with the "U" meaning "University", as my target audience are college students.


### Purpose of Interface Design
The purpose of interface design is to digitize and flesh out what was developed during the low-fidelity prototype stage. It's also another opportunity to get user input on their first impression of the site, and ensure that everything is presented in a digestible manner.
