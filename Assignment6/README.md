Hanna Co | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Overview
### Description of Project
The purpose of my project is to design a website for anyone, but primarily college students, to learn about sustainability, better habits into their lives, and get involved in initiatives that make a difference. The screen that I chose to design is the homepage, which in my low-fidelity prototype, I did not get a chance to fully lay out. The name I chose for my platform is SustainableU, which refers to both the user being more sustainable, but also a play on words, with the "U" meaning "University", as my target audience are college students.


### Purpose of Interface Design
The purpose of interface design is to digitize and flesh out what was developed during the low-fidelity prototype stage. It's also another opportunity to get user input on their first impression of the site, and ensure that everything is presented in a digestible manner.


### Design Process
I used my low fidelity prototype as a reference for my homepage. I began with a Macbook Air frame, as that's the laptop that I have. I laid out the components from my prototype, as well as extending the screen to include everything I wanted. I then decided on my color palette, using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) to help me pick a suitable color palette. I then made some variations in shape and typography to find a version that I liked. Finally, I created a dark mode version of the homepage.

## Screen Interface Designs

### Layout
I wasn't sure on how to lay out my site, so I referenced [this blog](https://elementor.com/blog/grid-design/) and went with their recommendation to use a modular grid. I ultimately chose a 12 column grid with 24px gutters. I decided on 150px margins, so the majority of my content would be in the center of the screen.

### Typographic Variations
I compared three different fonts: Kaisei HarunoUmi, IM FELL DW Pica, and Akaya Telivigala. When comparing the three, I felt that Kaisei HarunoUmi, while it looked clean, felt a bit too professional, and wasn't the image I wanted my site to have. On the other hand, Akaya Telivigala felt too casual. Thus, IM FELL DW Pica was the perfect middle ground.

### Shape Variations
I initially had rounded rectangles for my buttons, and had two radiuses: 6px and 11px. I also tried something more playful, and compared these options to using a leaf for the buttons. I decided to go with the 6px radius.

### Color Palettes
I created both a light mode and a dark mode for my design, although the colors used for both were very similar. The main difference is that the dark green I chose for dark mode is darker than in light mode, in order to create more contrast.

## Impression Testing

I showed my site to my subject, first conducting the 5-second test, showing her the site for five seconds and then asking for her first impression and anything she remembered or what stood out to her. The following are her intial thoughts on the site:

### 5-second-test finding:
- first image is prominent, and stands out
- color palette is very cohesive
- logo didn't really stand out

I then let her look at the figma file, and go through the homepage more thoroughly. As she did this, I asked for her feedback on the typography, colors, and layout of the site, as well as anything that she would like to see as a user.

### Color Palette
- High image contrast which makes it stand out
- Graphics are cohesive
- Colors are suited for the topic

### Layout
- Text is not centered
- Some elements should be closer to the center
- Article titles should be centered, and less close to the edge

### Typography
- Can be hard to read when the font is smaller

### Things she would like to see
- Being able to sign up for a mailing list would be nice

### Feedback Integration
After receiving feedback from my subject, I went back to my figma file and made some small changes based on her recommendations. I fixed the alignment and placement of my text to make it closer to the center, as well as choosing a new font that was more readable. Below is what the updated home page looks like.

## Accessibility + Contrast Check
I checked the contrast between the text and the background using Color contrast, a Figma plugin. They all passed the accessibility test.

## Final Screen Design & Design System

## Summary of why I made my design decisions

**Typography:** As mentioned before, I initally chose IM FELL DW Pica as my font, as I thought that it was suitable for my site. However, after conducting the impression test, I changed the font that was more simple and easy to read, without feeling too childish or complex.

**Color Palette:** Being that this site is focused on sustainability, I thought it was natural to use green, as it evokes feelings of nature. I chose it other than other "natural colors" (such as blue, purple, etc.) because I wanted a calming feeling. I created both a light mode and dark mode, adjusting colors for more contrast.

**Layout:** Going off a blog's recommendation, I went with a 12 column grid with 24px gutters. I played around with the margins, considering how much information I wanted to include on each line, and chose 150px, as it allowed me to include everything I wanted without cluttering the site.
