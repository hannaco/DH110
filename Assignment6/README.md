Hanna Co | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Overview
### Description of Project
The purpose of my project is to design a website for anyone, but primarily college students, to learn about sustainability, better habits into their lives, and get involved in initiatives that make a difference. The screen that I chose to design is the homepage, which in my low-fidelity prototype, I did not get a chance to fully lay out. The name I chose for my platform is SustainableU, which refers to both the user being more sustainable, but also a play on words, with the "U" meaning "University", as my target audience are college students.


### Purpose of Interface Design
The purpose of interface design is to digitize and flesh out what was developed during the low-fidelity prototype stage. It's also another opportunity to get user input on their first impression of the site, and ensure that everything is presented in a digestible manner.

## Screen Interface Designs

### Layout
I wasn't sure on how to lay out my site, so I referenced [this blog](https://elementor.com/blog/grid-design/) and went with their recommendation to use a modular grid. I ultimately chose a 12 column grid with 24px gutters. I decided on 150px margins, so the majority of my content would be in the center of the screen.

### Typographic Variations
I compared three different fonts: Kaisei HarunoUmi, IM FELL DW Pica, and Akaya Telivigala. When comparing the three, I felt that Kaisei HarunoUmi, while it looked clean, felt a bit too professional, and wasn't the image I wanted my site to have. On the other hand, Akaya Telivigala felt too casual. Thus, IM FELL DW Pica was the perfect middle ground.

### Shape Variations
I initially had rounded rectangles for my buttons, and had two radiuses: 6px and 11px. I also tried something more playful, and compared these options to using a leaf for the buttons. I decided to go with the 6px radius.

### Color Palettes
I created both a light mode and a dark mode for my design, although the colors used for both were very similar. The main difference is that the dark green I chose for dark mode is darker than in light mode, in order to create more contrast.

### Summary

## Accessibility + Contrast Check
I checked the contrast between the text and the background using Color contrast, a Figma plugin. They all passed the accessibility test.

## Final Screen Design & Design System

### Screen Design
Below is the final screen design, in light mode, using IM FELL DW Pica and 6px radius rounded rectangles.

## Summary of why I made my design decisions

**Typography:** As mentioned before, I went with IM FELL DW Pica because I felt that it was a good middle ground between playful and professional, while also being readable. I was simple and modern, yet it wasn't too clean cut.

**Color Palette:** Being that this site is focused on sustainability, I thought it was natural to use green, as it evokes feelings of nature. I chose it other than other "natural colors" (such as blue, purple, etc.) because I wanted a calming feeling. I created both a light mode and dark mode, adjusting colors for more contrast.

**Layout:** Going off a blog's recommendation, I went with a 12 column grid with 24px gutters. I played around with the margins, considering how much information I wanted to include on each line, and chose 150px, as it allowed me to include everything I wanted without cluttering the site.
