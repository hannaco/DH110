<h3>How to Create Sustianable Cities</h3>
Name: Hanna Co <br/>
Course: UI/UX Design (DH 110) <br/>
Project: The topic of my project this quarter will be centered around the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Sustainable Cities and Communities. <br/>
This project will be focused on how we as individuals can contribute to sustainable city living. I plan on designing a site, simliar to a community forum, where members can share ideas to be more sustainable and discuss issues they see.
