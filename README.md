# SustainableU

## Hanna Co | DH 110 | Fall 2022

### Design Statement
This project will be focused on how we as individuals can contribute to sustainable city living. Many sites talk about sustainability, but often are looking on a larger scale, which can discourage the viewer or give them the feeling that they are alleviated from individual responsibility to live more sustainably. Thus, I want to design a site that explains these issues at a large scale, but gives the viewer action items they can do to take steps towards sustainable living.

### Research
I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the United Nations Environment Programme and Global Environment Facility in order to better understand current pain points of the user when learning about sustainability. See more at the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/hannaco/DH110/blob/main/Assignment1/README.md).
