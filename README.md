<h3>How to Create Sustianable Cities</h3>
Name: Hanna Co <br/>
Course: UI/UX Design (DH 110) <br/>
Project: The topic of my project this quarter will be centered around the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Sustainable Cities and Communities. <br/>
This project will be focused on how we as individuals can contribute to sustainable city living. Many sites talk about sustainability, but often are looking on a larger scale, which can discourage the viewer or give them the feeling that they are alleviated from individual responsibility to live more sustainably. Thus, I want to design a site that explains these issues at a large scale, but gives the viewer action items they can do to take steps towards sustainable living.
