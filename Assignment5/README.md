# Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype
Hanna Co | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Overview
Note: Based on feedback from the professor, I've adjusted the goals and purpose of my site to reflect that. Thus, it might differ from the scenarios outlined in the persona and usage scenarios.

### Project Description and Purpose
My current project is focused on helping college-aged individuals learn about sustainability in an accessible and engaging way. Additionally, it also helps them get involved in sustainable activities that are accessible and feasible for them.

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to quickly test the functionality of a website. Doing so can help find any usability issues early on, as well as get feedback on how users expect to interact with the site. By using a low-fidelity prototype, as opposed to a high-fidelity prototype, it is not only cheaper, but since it is early on in the design process, it is still easy to make any changes and adjustments necessary. 

### User Research
Based on the results of my [user research](https://github.com/hannaco/DH110/tree/main/Assignment3), I will be focusing on two main barriers or constraints that stood out to me:
1. Engagement - most sites aren't engaging when it comes to learning about sustainability, making it seem like a chore to users, and failing to make them feel connected to the issue
2. Ways to get involved - recommended ways to get involved are often not realistic for the average person, which often discourages them

### User Personas
I created two [personas](https://github.com/hannaco/DH110/tree/main/Assignment4) centered around these barriers:
1. A female student who wants to get involved and feel encouraged that her actions are important
2. A male college student who is tired of reading through articles on sustainability 

## Tasks
1. Learn more about sustainability
2. Find ways to get involved in sustainability

## Wireframes and Wireflow


## Prototype Testing
