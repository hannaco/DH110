# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Hanna Co | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview
### Description of Project
The purpose of my project is to design a website for anyone, but primarily college students, to learn about sustainability, better habits into their lives, and get involved in initiatives that make a difference. This high-fidelity prototype is a redesign of UNEP's website. It aims to make learning about sustainability a more interactive experience, and make sustainability more accessible to more people.

### Purpose of Interactive Prototype
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to visualize how the website would look, and test whether or not it is intuitive for users. It allows the designer to not only evaluate the design, but also the usability of their product.

### Process of Interactive Prototype
I used my low-fidelity prototype and system interface design to create my high-fidelity prototype in Figma. After this was completed, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough and usability test, and based on these results, made changes to my prototype accordingly.

## Tasks
This interactive prototype supports 2 tasks:
1. Learning about sustainability
2. Finding ways that they can get involved in sustainability

## Wireflow w/ final interface design
For clarity, I split up the wireflow by tasks.

### Task 1 Wireflow

## Prototype 1 (1st Iteration):
The first iteration of my prototype can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/MpXh0UckAMhi8G7RhVRBIo/DH-110-Assignment-7?node-id=9%3A1157&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=9%3A1157).

## Cognitive Walkthrough & Usability Tests

### Cognitive Walkthrough:

The cognitive walkthrough went smoothly, and the testers were able to complete the tasks and navigate the site smoothly. They mostly had positive feedback, but one of my testers mentioned that it may not be intuitive for user the know where to look for games, or for the knowledge test. I did debate changing this, but my other tester had no problem with this, thus I chose to leave the site as it, as I felt that it was correctly categorized as learning activities.

### Usability Tests:

The usability test went very smoothly, and the subject was able to complete all the tasks quickly, with minimal confusion, which is a good sign. The subject also indicated that the site appeared easy to use and trustworthy, and described it as "creative" and "impressive". Regardless, there are a couple things that the subject indicated could be improved.
1. The font may be a little harder to read
> This is conflicting, as my previous subject from the interface design stage indicated that this font was easy to read. Regardless, I tested out different fonts to see if there were others that would improve readability. Ultimately, I chose to remain with the same font, as other fonts were too complex, or were too difficult to read when the font was small.
2. Having dropdown menus for the navigation bar would remove some confusion.
> I added dropdown menus that appeared on hover.

## Prototype 2 (Revision):

After receiving feedback and contemplating ways to change my prototype, I ended up with my second iteration, which can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/jJakv2pwkIPeGjFM7sfS5Z/DH-110-Assignment-7-V2?node-id=9%3A1157&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=9%3A1157).

There were few revisions, as I had to weigh the pros and cons of integrating feeback. For example, one subject said the font was readable, while others thought that the font was perfect. Another said the site layout could be improved, while others stated that everything was clear and easy to use. In the end, I mostly went with the majority opinion, as I didn't want to disregard the feedback of the majority for one person's opinion, as that might end in a site that is only tailored for that one individual to use. The main change I made was adding dropdowns for the navigation menu, so that when the user hovered over them, a dropdown would appear. This allows the user to navigate the site easier. The change is reflected in the prototype, although due to the limitations of figma, the dropdowns only appear on the home page, but in development, these dropdowns would appear on any page the user was on.
