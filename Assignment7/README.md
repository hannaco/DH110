# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Hanna Co | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview
### Description of Project
The purpose of my project is to design a website for anyone, but primarily college students, to learn about sustainability, better habits into their lives, and get involved in initiatives that make a difference. This high-fidelity prototype is a redesign of UNEP's website. It aims to make learning about sustainability a more interactive experience, and make sustainability more accessible to more people.

### Purpose of Interactive Prototype
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to visualize how the website would look, and test whether or not it is intuitive for users. It allows the designer to not only evaluate the design, but also the usability of their product.

### Process of Interactive Prototype
I used my low-fidelity prototype and system interface design to create my high-fidelity prototype in Figma. After this was completed, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough and usability test, and based on these results, made changes to my prototype accordingly.

## Tasks
This interactive prototype supports 2 tasks:
1. Learning about sustainability
2. Finding ways that they can get involved in sustainability
