# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Hanna Co | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview
### Description of Project
The purpose of my project is to design a website for anyone, but primarily college students, to learn about sustainability, better habits into their lives, and get involved in initiatives that make a difference. This high-fidelity prototype is a redesign of UNEP's website. It aims to make learning about sustainability a more interactive experience, and make sustainability more accessible to more people.

### Purpose of Interactive Prototype
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to visualize how the website would look, and test whether or not it is intuitive for users. It allows the designer to not only evaluate the design, but also the usability of their product.

### Process of Interactive Prototype
I used my low-fidelity prototype and system interface design to create my high-fidelity prototype in Figma. After this was completed, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough and usability test, and based on these results, made changes to my prototype accordingly.

## Tasks
This interactive prototype supports 2 tasks:
1. Learning about sustainability
2. Finding ways that they can get involved in sustainability

## Wireflow w/ final interface design
For clarity, I split up the wireflow by tasks.

### Task 1 Wireflow

## Cognitive Walkthrough & Usability Tests

### Cognitive Walkthrough:

| Tester Name | What do you see? | What do you think that web/app is about? | What do you think you can do with this web/app? | Any other comments? | Is there any point that the users may not understand what this screen(feedback) is about? | Is there any point that the users may not recognize where to click or select? | Is there any point that the users may feel lost and may not sure whether the progress is being made toward what they want to achieve? | Is there any point that the users would not know what to do the next step? | Is there any point that is not clear where to return or missing back-flow of cancel or exit? | Is there anything inconsistent, missing, or confusing? | Any other comments? |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

| Vicky Jen   | sustainability theme, some articles, ways to get involved | sustainability | learn sustainability, get involved with volunteer events | no | yes its very straight forward and clear | no, it is very self explanatory | no, the user can feel the progress being made | no | no | no | no |

### Usability Tests:

The usability test went very smoothly, and the subject was able to complete all the tasks quickly, with minimal confusion, which is a good sign. The subject also indicated that the site appeared easy to use and trustworthy, and described it as "creative" and "impressive". Regardless, there are a couple things that the subject indicated could be improved.
1. The font may be a little harder to read
> This is conflicting, as my previous subject from the interface design stage indicated that this font was easy to read. Regardless, I tested out different fonts to see if there were others that would improve readability. Ultimately, I chose to remain with the same font, as other fonts were too complex, or were too difficult to read when the font was small.
2. Having dropdown menus for the navigation bar would remove some confusion.
> I added dropdown menus that appeared on hover.
