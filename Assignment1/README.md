# Individual Responsibility for Sustainability

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

### About the project

There are many sites online that talk about sustainability issues, and discuss root causes. However, a lot of these sites only talk about problems and solutions on a large scale, which often takes responsibility away from the user to take action. Additionally, many of these websites are not user-friendly, which deters viewers from reading further. With these points in mind, I plan to design a site that is more user-friendly and intuitive to use. This site will also detail smaller actions that an individual can integrate into their daily lives in an effort to live more sustainably.

### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

Ratings are displayed in parentheses after each usability issue.

## Website 1: [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/)

### About
[UNEP](https://www.unep.org/) is the United Nations Environment Programme, and it sets the agenda for environmental actions and advocates for the environment. This site provides insight into who UNEP is, as well as what they do across the world. As such an authority in sustainability, this site is often visited by users across the globe looking for more information on how we are working to fight climate change. Since so many users visit this site, it is important that it is easy to use, and not overwhelming to one who has no prior knowledge on UNEP.

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* The site highlights which item on the navigation bar the user is currently looking at. The user's cursor changes when it hovers over clickable links or text boxes.

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* Under the 'Where We Work' section, it's unintuitive why 'North America' and 'New York Office' are separated, and why 'West Asia' and 'Asia and the Pacific' are separated. (2)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep2a.png" alt="Navigation Bar" width = "500px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Use clearer distinctions between the listed regions, either by listing offices, or countries/continents where they work.*

* The icon on the far right is actually clickable, and takes the user to a site on the UN sustainability goals. Not every user may know that is what this represents, which could potentially be confusing. (1)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep2b.png" alt="UN Sustainability Goals" width = "300px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Somewhere close to this icon should be a small subtitle that explains what this represents.*

#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* On some of the links in the navigation bar, it's not clear to the user that clicking the option will open a new tab. In the image below, clicking on UN Environment Assembly, redirects the user to a different webpage, which can make the user feel out of control. (2)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep3.png" alt="UNEP Navigation" width = "500px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: There is a commonly used icon to indicate that the link opens in a new tab, which should be used to make that clearer to the user.*

#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* The sub-menu for 'What we do' looks different from all the other sub-menus, as shown below. (2)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep4a.png" alt="UNEP What We Do"/>
  <img src="./unep4b.png" alt="Where we work"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: The sub-menus should be standardized, and a design chosen that works for both.*

#### 5. Error Prevention
* The search does not support suggestions, making it prone to typos. Additionally, the search does not return similar results, which can be problematic if the user does not know how to spell a word or doesn't notice the type. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep5.png" alt="UNEP Search" width="500px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: We can either suggest results as the user types, or if the word is close in spelling to another commonly searched word, we can return results for that word as well, similar to what Google does.*

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
* Many of the menu options have sub-menu options nestled within it, forcing the user to recall the organization of the site. (3)

> *Recommendation: Try re-organizing the navigation bar to reduce the number of sub-menu items to a reasonable amount.*

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* The only way to search is to click the text box and start typing, and press 'Enter' â€“ the magnifying glass is not a functioning icon. (2)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep7a.png" alt="UNEP Search Bar" width="300px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Allow the user to search by clicking on the magnifying glass.*

* The image carousel shown below is unintuitive to use, because clicking the left button scrolls the images to the right, and vice versa. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep7b.png" alt="UNEP Image Carousel" width="500px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Make it so that the button direction matches the scroll direction, which is more intuitive.*

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
* The footer is very long and packed with information, as is the header. It is very overwhelming to look at, especially when the header and footer tend to be more simple and concise on other sites. (2)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep8a.png" alt="UNEP Footer" width="500px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: A lot of this information can be rearranged to make the design more minimalistic and less overwhelming. The footer in particular should be reduced to just contact and copyright information, instead of being another navigation tool.*

* The site essentially has two navigation bars, which is unnecessary and just causes more confusion for the user. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep8b.png" alt="UNEP Footer" width="500px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Consolidate the information from both of the navigation bars to minimize user confusion.*

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* To subscribe to their newsletter, it requires the user's email address. However, you are able to submit the form with invalid inputs, and the user is never informed. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep9.png" alt="UNEP Subscrie" width="500px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: The site should perform form validation and display error messages if required fields are missing or have invalid inputs.*

#### 10. Help and Documentation
* Users are able to contact them for help, but there is no guide to help the user navigate the site, and there isn't a FAQ section to answer common questions that one may have. Thus, they may have to wait for a response every time they have a question. (2)

> *Recommendation:  Compile a FAQ and add that as a section on their website, so users have somewhere to look if they need help.*

### Overall Assessment

This site is incredibly information-heavy, and despite having a good balance of images and well-spaced content, it still easily overwhelms the viewer. Its main issue is that the header, footer, and menus contain too much information, which leaves a lot of room for user error. Other than that, it has some minor issues regarding efficiency, consistency, etc.


## Website 2: [Global Environment Facility](https://www.thegef.org/)

### About
[GEF](https://www.thegef.org/) stands for Global Environment Facility, and funds biodiversity and conservation projects across the globe. This site gives insight into who GEF is, and the types of problems they address. The user is also able to take a look at the kinds of projects they work with, and get updates through their 'Newsroom'.

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* There is no indication that you are on the home page, as you navigate to it by clicking the GEF logo in the upper left. There is no other way to navigate to the home page. (1)

<p align="center">
  <img src="gef1a.png" alt="GEF Navigation" width="350px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Add home as a navigation bar item, and add the same highlighting as the other navigation bar options when the user is on that particular page.*

* They have an interactive chat on the bottom right that allows the user to ask for help. When the user hovers over the text box, the cursor doesn't change, and there is no other indication that the user can start typing their query. (2)

<p align="center">
  <img src="gef1b.png" alt="GEF Chat" width="350px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Change the user's cursor when they hover, and have some indication that the user can start typing.*

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* A lot of the options in the sub-menus have similar meanings, such as the one shown below. This can confuse users, and they may not know which one to navigate to. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="gef2.png" alt="GEF Sub-Menu" width="350px"/>
</p>

*Recommendation: Remove the options that have similar meanings, such as Newsletter and News.*

#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* The site does not have fast response time, and as a result, the menus often all appear at the time time, especially when the user is looking at them very fast. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="gef3.png" alt="GEF Sub-Menu" width="350px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation:  Design a more responsive site to avoid this issue.*

* When the user clicks 'Contact Us', gmail is opened in the same tab, and an email draft is started. This doesn't give the user the feeling of control, as they didn't choose the next action. In addition, if the user decides not to email them, deleting the draft closes the tab, and forces the user to reopen a tab and navigate back to the site. (3)

> *Recommendation: Clicking contact us provides the user with contact information, or opens gmail in a new tab.*

#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* Not every page has the same layout, which is a small issue, but does not look aesthetically pleasing. (1)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./gef4a" alt="GEF Page 1"/>
  <img src="./gef4b" alt="GEF Page 2"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Choose one specific layout, and use that across the site.*

* Similarly, the search fields are misaligned, which doesn't affect usability, but doesn't look good. (1)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./gef4c" alt="GEF Misaligned Search"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Align all the fields and buttons horizontally.*

* In the chat, the typography for the username and password are not the same, which is another minor aesthetic issue. (1)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./gef4d" alt="GEF Login"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Use the same font, color, size and weight for consistency.*

#### 5. Error Prevention
* Phone numbers change based on which tab of the Community Health Center page the user is on. However, it is difficult to recognize this because these phone numbers aren't displayed below the tabs. It is easy for users to call the wrong number or send an email to the wrong email address. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="../Images/behavioral-health-contact.PNG" alt="Contact information for Behavioral Health" width="550px"/>
  
  <img src="../Images/dental-clinic-contact.PNG" alt="Contact information for Dental Clinic" width="550px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Put the tabs above the content so that users know what information is relevant to which department. Put the contact information in a consistent and easy-to-find location for each tap. Alternatively, direct users to a contact page where they can easily find where they should contact.*

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
* When you hover over the top navigation menu, there is no indication of which menu item's dropdown is being displayed, forcing users to recall which of the menu items they were looking at. This also makes it more difficult for users to remember how they got to a certain page in the future. (2)

<p align="center">
  <img src="../Images/nav-services.PNG" alt="Navigation Menu, Services" width="350px"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Connect the dropdown box with the menu item title to show that the dropdown is under that header.*

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* There is no search bar on the website. Given the extent of content and resources they provide, it would be very helpful to be able to search keywords that will lead users to the information they are looking for. (2)

> *Recommendation: Implement a search function to allow users another option to efficiently navigate through the website.*

* On the homepage, the first image is about free COVID-19 vaccines. The image, however, is not clickable and does not lead to another page with the details, as one would expect. Instead, the user must look through the website to find the full image/pdf. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="../Images/csc-homepage.PNG" alt="CSC homepage"/>
</p>

* I was able to find it under "Upcoming Events" at the bottom of the homepage, where users are unlikely to scroll to. Even then, the information was elusive - the carousel constantly autorotates through random images/pdfs of different events, and the only way to navigate through them is through the left and right arrow keys. Furthermore, although there is an Events category under "More" in the top navigation menu, it is not clickable. (3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="../Images/upcoming-events-2.PNG" alt="Upcoming Events carousel with free vaccine event information"/>
</p>

> *Recommendation: Because these free events are an integral part of CSC services, it makes sense to put a working Events link in the top navigation menu. On the Events page, separate upcoming events from past events. If possible, provide the information directly on the page rather than in image or pdf format so that users don't have to open another tab or window to view the information. Organize events by category, clearly provide dates and times, show relevant pictures.*

#### 8. Aesthetics and Minimalist Design
* Throughout the website, we see an unappealing interface due to incorrect placement of features, inconsistent fonts, colors, and other design aspects, low-quality images, cluttered and conflicting elements, and web developer mistakes. Altogether, the website is confusing for any user and lowers the credibility of the organization. The Community Health Center homepage, in particular, demonstrates this well. (3)

![CSC Community Health Center homepage](../Images/community-health-center-homepage.PNG)

> *Recommendation: Firstly, we need to fix the web developer mistakes so that the features are at least visible. For instance, the language switch needs to be fully visible so that users know they can switch the language of the website (important for the large, nonnative English-speaking user base). Next, de-clutter the website by reorganizing the information presented. For example, it is unnecessary to place the Community Health Center description at the beginning of every tab's page; use that real estate for the menu itself. Lastly, make sure that a design guideline is used so that font sizes, spacing, and colors are appropriate for seniors and consistent throughout.*

* The transparency of the tall fixed navigation menu dominates the layout of the page, and is very distracting. The menu is difficult to see and use, especially as users scroll down the page and there is text under the menu. (3)
* The social media icons don't need to be fixed because they can interrupt content. The user base likely doesn't use much social media anyways. (1)

> *Recommendation: Make the navigation menu opaque, and make it thinner by using the full width of the page and including only the necessary menu items so that more information can be displayed at a given time. Put social media icons in the footer, or at the top right if social media is actually used a lot by users (unlikely).*

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* When the wrong account information is entered on the patient portal, there is no indication of whether the username or password was incorrect (or both). (1)

> *Recommendation: Tell users which field is incorrect so that they can only fix what's needed.*

#### 10. Help and Documentation
* Virtually no help or documentation is provided on the website; the email and phone number are prominently displayed, so it is assumed that people would simply call or email to make an appointment or request information. Common information (such as what insurance they accept, phone numbers for different departments, how to request a "token" to access the patient portal) is randomly dispersed throughout the website. (3)

* A lot of information tends to be displayed via images and brochures, but it is difficult to find them. (3)

> *Recommendation: Consolidate important general information on one page so that users are not completely confused. Provide a link to the contact page instead of randomly displaying the phone number and email. Provide more guidance to users on each page; there are many different departments, phone numbers, and locations. For example, who, where, and when exactly should a person contact if they are a new patient?*

### Overall Assessment

A lot of work needs to be done in many areas, but the areas to focus on first are probably flexibility & efficiency of use and aesthetics & minimalist design. Their health resources are invaluable to many low-income, immigrant families and their seniors, so being able to access that information easily should be prioritized. Also, an important feature to fix first is the visibility of the language switch, since many of their users may be Chinese monolinguals. The website is very harsh to look at in general, making it very difficult to use and makes CSC look unreliable. An update on aesthetics should therefore be one of their next steps.
