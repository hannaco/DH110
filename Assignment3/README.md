## Introductory Steps 

## Research Goal & Requirements

### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will support users in learning more about what they can do to promote sustainability and take care of our environment. The user demographic I want to target is college students, and help them understand exactly what sustainability is and make it more applicable to them.
  
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This will help the user feel more proactive in fighting climate change, promoting their self esteem and giving them a sense of accomplishment. This fulfills the user's cognitive need, aiding them in becoming more knowledgeable and giving meaning to their actions.
  
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to help users get involved with sustainability varies. Users might learn about issues regarding our environment through the news, social media, or also through internet searches. They can get involved through organizations at their university, local initiatives, or again through online resources. Some of these do tend to move slowly, work on a larger scale, or don't have clear actions the user can take to help promote sustainability in their lives.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
With technology, learning more about sustainability and taking action becomes more accessible, being a quick search away. Furthermore, on a digital platform, it is easier to simply update the user and we learn more, ensuring that the users are getting the most recent information we have.

## Target Users

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
Demographic: College students interested in sustainability, potentially more concerned with climate change and human impact on the environment
Preference: Users prefer to spend their time improving the sustainability of their lifestyle or city
Expertise: There is no experience required for users to use this site

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
There's many ways that users can be involved with sustainability. Since the main activity is finding ways to integrate sustainable habits into their lives, users are most likely to engage with the website from their home, but this is not always the case. They can also participate in the activity at the university, or anywhere in their local community. The most likely reason that the user would engage in this activity is to try and replace some of the current habits with a more sustainable lifestyle.

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
Users would typically search the internet for sustainability issues and try to find ways that they can help. Specifically on UNEP, they can click the "Get Involved" tab to find ways they can be involved and active in sustainability.

## Insights from the Interview 
### If you were to participate in activities or make lifestyle changes related to environmental preservation or sustainability, what are factors important to you? Why?
"I'd say cost and like, I guess like how easy it is like access it, cuz I think those are like the two main defining factors in like whether or not I would do that."

### What do you think stops most people from engaging in these activities?
"Yeah, I'd say like probably money  I feel like a lot of people like wouldn't choose something sustainable over something that's not because like it's usually a bit more expensive even though like it lasts longer. And then like I guess education about it too, like some people don't know or like think that their, what, like whatever they change in their lifestyle won't have a big impact so I feel like they wouldn't do it cuz they're like oh it doesn't matter anyways."

### Thoughts and reactions towards suggested ways to get involved.
"They have like a take action page and I guess it has like like alerts on why it matters and then a tip guide that explains how you can create a plan for action and I think there's like a donation tab as well. I think that's it."

"Um, I feel like it isn't [a practical way to get individuals involved], cuz like the main thing they do is like go to court for people who are like, like trying to, I guess like challenge the law and stuff. So I don't think like an individual that's like not a lawyer can like really contribute to their thing besides like donating. So I don't think it's like that practical."

"[regarding feelings about this] I guess that's kind of like a deterrent in like, like if you like did all the work to search up this website, excited to get involved it'd be like you can't really help so that'd be a little like disappointing, I guess."

### Accessibility of information and feasibility of suggested actions.
"Um, yes. I think it's [finding and understanding the information], yeah, pretty easy."

"Um, I think like, like when I Googled it, like, like Google had like a good summary of it and then like I think that when I clicked on like this Earth Justice website like it was very organized and like tell you what they did and like how they helped and stuff and the donate button was really clear."

"Maybe just like put actual ways that like normal people could help. I think like the things they had were like the action tip guide which wasn't really like like a way you could help it's just like telling you how you could make a plan to help. But, yeah."

## Reflection 
I really enjoyed conducting user research, as I think it was beneficial to take a step away from my particular website, and take a look at the general goals I am trying to accomplish. My participatory observation research allowed me to gain some valuable insights from the user's perspective, and it confirmed a lot of the concerns I was trying to address, but it also brought up new concerns I hadn't considered before. For example, it confirmed my worry that the feasibility of the suggested actions would deter and discourage users from being more proactive. Something I thought was interesting was the user's level of interest and passion â€“ despite already doing things to be more sustainable, they weren't incredibly dedicated to sustainability. Insights such as these allow me to focus on certain aspects of my project, and what to prioritize. At first, I found it difficult finding tasks for the user to do, and it was difficult making the subject feel comfortable, because unlike my subject for usability testing, this subject wasn't familiar with the user research process, so it was all very unfamiliar. Next time I conduct usability testing, I will make sure to give the user more direction on the activities and make them less open ended. My subject seemed lost and confused when I gave them time to research on their own, and it seemed that they needed some sort of goal or topic to look for or focus on.
