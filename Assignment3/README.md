## Introductory Steps 

## Research Goal & Requirements

### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will support users in learning more about what they can do to promote sustainability and take care of our environment. The user demographic I want to target is college students, and help them understand exactly what sustainability is and make it more applicable to them.
  
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This will help the user feel more proactive in fighting climate change, promoting their self esteem and giving them a sense of accomplishment. This fulfills the user's cognitive need, aiding them in becoming more knowledgeable and giving meaning to their actions.
  
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to help users get involved with sustainability varies. Users might learn about issues regarding our environment through the news, social media, or also through internet searches. They can get involved through organizations at their university, local initiatives, or again through online resources. Some of these do tend to move slowly, work on a larger scale, or don't have clear actions the user can take to help promote sustainability in their lives.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
With technology, learning more about sustainability and taking action becomes more accessible, being a quick search away. Furthermore, on a digital platform, it is easier to simply update the user and we learn more, ensuring that the users are getting the most recent information we have.

## Target Users

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
Demographic: College students interested in sustainability, potentially more concerned with climate change and human impact on the environment
Preference: Users prefer to spend their time improving the sustainability of their lifestyle or city
Expertise: There is no experience required for users to use this site

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
There's many ways that users can be involved with sustainability. Since the main activity is finding ways to integrate sustainable habits into their lives, users are most likely to engage with the website from their home, but this is not always the case. They can also participate in the activity at the university, or anywhere in their local community. The most likely reason that the user would engage in this activity is to try and replace some of the current habits with a more sustainable lifestyle.

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
Users would typically search the internet for sustainability issues and try to find ways that they can help. Specifically on UNEP, they can click the "Get Involved" tab to find ways they can be involved and active in sustainability.
